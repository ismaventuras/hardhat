# A TypeScript Hardhat project using Mocha and Ethers

> WARNING: This demonstration project is still in development. It is part of the Hardhat v3 upgrade. It is not for production use.

> NOTE: There are several plugins from the Hardhat toolbox that have not been ported to Hardhat v3 yet. In testing terms, the biggist ommision is `hardhat-chai-matchers`.

This project demonstrates basic Hardhat usecases within a TypeScript project. It comes with a minimal Hardhat configuration file and a test.

For integration testing it uses the Mocha test runner and the Ethers.js library for interacting with Ethereum nodes.

Try running the following commands to see Hardhat in action:

```shell
# Setup a running Hardhat v2 node in another terminal: `npx hardhat node`

# The test command does not currently trigger the compilation step
npx hardhat3 compile
# Run the mocha integration test suite
npx hardhat3 test
```
